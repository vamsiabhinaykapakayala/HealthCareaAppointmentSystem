Our project is a Health Care Appointment System designed to simplify and streamline the process of booking and managing medical appointments. The system features two primary user roles: Doctors and Patients.

Patients can:
Register and log in to their accounts.
View available doctors and their specializations.
Book appointments with doctors based on available time slots.
Receive confirmation and status updates of their appointments.

Doctors can:
Log in securely to their profiles.
View a dashboard of all upcoming patient appointments.
Check patient details related to the appointments.
Manage and update their availability if required.
